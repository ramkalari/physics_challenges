Most of an atom's mass is in the nucleus.   
How many electrons would a hydrogen ion need to have the same mass in the electron cloud that it has in the nucleus?  
Hint: it would be highly charged and certainly not stable!

Mass of a proton = 1.67 * 10^-27 kg
Mass of a electron = 9.11 * 10^-31 kg

Expected Time to solve: 1 to 15 minutes
